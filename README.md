> Translating "dump" or "useless outfit" into German yields "Saftladen" which can be reverse-translated word by word into "juice shop". Hence the name of this project.    
 
## Features

- Easy to install: Just requires [node.js](www.nodejs.org)
- Self contained: Additional dependencies will be resolved and downloaded automatically
- No external DB:  A simple file based SQLite database is used which is wiped and regenerated on server startup
- Open source: No hidden costs or caveats
 
## Getting started
1. Install [node.js](www.nodejs.org)
2. Run ```npm install``` (only has to be done before first start or when you change the source code)
3. Run ```npm start```
4. Browse to http://localhost:3000

You may find it easier to find vulnerabilities using a pen test tool. I strongly recommend
[Zed Attack Proxy](https://code.google.com/p/zaproxy/) which is open source and very powerful, yet beginner friendly.
